	abstract = {An improved version of the immersed boundary (IB) method is developed for simulating ﬂexible ﬁlaments in a uniform ﬂow. The proposed IB method is based on an eﬃcient Navier–Stokes solver adopting the fractional step method and a staggered Cartesian grid system. The ﬂuid motion deﬁned on an Eulerian grid and the ﬁlament motion deﬁned on a Lagrangian grid are independently solved and their interaction force is explicitly calculated using a feedback law. A direct numerical method is developed to calculate the ﬁlament motion under the constraint of inextensibility. When applied to the case of a swinging ﬁlament analogous to a rope pendulum, the proposed method gave results very similar to those of the analytical solution derived using the perturbation method. For a ﬂexible ﬁlament ﬂapping in a uniform ﬂow, the mechanism by which small vortex processions are produced was investigated. The bistable property of the system was observed by altering the ﬁlament length, and the eﬀects of the boundary condition at the ﬁxed end (simply supported or clamped) were studied. For two side-by-side ﬁlaments in a uniform ﬂow, both in-phase ﬂapping and out-of-phase ﬂapping were reproduced in the present simulations. A repulsive force was included in the formulation to handle collisions between the free ends of side-by-side ﬁlaments undergoing out-of-phase ﬂapping.},

The description is begun at the level of small “particles”, and the continuum level is taken later on. However, when a computational solution is sought, the description turns back to the discrete level again. We ﬁrst consider the easier case of a string under tension, and then focus on the beam.

            The finite difference method is applied to derive approximate solutions for the bending line of Euler‐Bernoulli beam problems. The investigations are restricted to simple static configurations, i. e. straight beams with constant symmetrical cross‐sections and constant elastic material properties. Only finite difference schemes of second‐order accuracy are considered and special emphasis is given to the implementation of the boundary conditions. Based on comparisons with the exact solutions, clear recommendations can be given on the required number of nodes to obtain a certain accuracy in the numerical approach.

	abstract = {The dynamics of slender ﬁlaments or ﬁbers suspended in Stokesian ﬂuids are fundamental to understanding many ﬂows arising in physics, biology and engineering. Such ﬁlaments can have aspect ratios of length to radius ranging from a few tens to several thousands. Full discretizations of such 3D ﬂows are very costly. Instead, we employ a non-local slender body theory that yields an integral equation, along the ﬁlament centerline, relating the force exerted on the body to the ﬁlament velocity. This hydrodynamical description takes into account the eﬀect of the ﬁlament on the ﬂuid, and is extended to capture the interaction of multiple ﬁlaments as mediated by the intervening ﬂuid. We consider ﬁlaments that are inextensible and elastic. Replacing the force in the slender body integral equation by an explicit expression that uses Euler–Bernoulli theory to model bending and tensile forces yields an integral expression for the velocity of the ﬁlament centerlines, coupled to auxiliary integro-diﬀerential equations for the ﬁlament tensions. Based on a regularized version of these slender body equations that is asymptotically equivalent to the original formulation, we construct a numerical method which uses a combination of ﬁnite diﬀerences, implicit time-stepping to avoid severe stability constraints, and special quadrature methods for nearly singular integrals. We present simulations of single ﬂexible ﬁlaments, as well as multiple interacting ﬁlaments, evolving in a background shear ﬂow. These simulations show shear induced buckling and relaxation of the ﬁlaments, leading to the storage and release of elastic energy. These dynamics are responsible for the development of positive ﬁrst normal stress diﬀerences, commonly associated with visco-elastic ﬂuids that are suspensions of microscopic elastic ﬁbers.},

              R
              0
              ) is straight but is otherwise of arbitrary shape. It is immersed in fluid whose undisturbed velocity, at the position of the body and relative to it, may be either uniform, corresponding to translational motion of the body, parallel or perpendicular to the body length, or a linear function of distance along the body length, corresponding to an ambient pure straining motion or to rotational motion of the body. Inertia forces are negligible. It is possible to represent the body approximately by a distribution of Stokeslets over a line enclosed by the body; and then the resultant force required to sustain translational motion, the net stresslet strength in a straining motion, and the resultant couple required to sustain rotational motion, can all be calculated. In the first approximation the Stokeslet strength density
              F
              (
              x
              ) is independent of the body shape and is of order μ

              U

              F
              (
              x
              ) depends on both the body cross-section and the way in which it varies along the length. From an investigation of the ‘inner’ flow field near one section of the body, and the condition that it should join smoothly with the ‘outer’ flow which is determined by the body as a whole, it is found that a given shape and size of the local cross-section is equivalent, in all cases of longitudinal relative motion, to a circle of certain radius, and, in all cases of transverse relative motion, to an ellipse of certain dimensions and orientation. The equivalent circle and the equivalent ellipse may be found from certain boundary-value problems for the harmonic and biharmonic equations respectively. The perimeter usually provides a better measure of the magnitude of the effect of a non-circular shape of a cross-section than its area. Explicit expressions for the various integral force parameters correct to the order of ε

	abstract = {Recent work in bio-fluid dynamics has studied the relation of fluid drag to flow speed for flexible organic structures, such as tree leaves, seaweed, and coral beds, and found a reduction in drag growth due to body reconfiguration with increasing flow speed. Our theoretical and experimental work isolates the role of elastic bending in this process. Using a flexible glass fiber wetted into a vertical soap-film flow, we identify a transition in flow speed beyond which fluid forces dominate the elastic response, and yield large deformations of the fiber that greatly reduce drag. We construct free-streamline models that couple fluid and elastic forces and solve them in an efficient numerical scheme. Shape self-similarity emerges, with a scaling set by the balance of forces in a small “tip region” about the flow’s stagnation point. The result is a transition from the classical U2 drag scaling of rigid bodies to a new U4/3 drag law. We derive an asymptotic expansion for the fiber shape and flow, based on the length-scale of similarity. This analysis predicts that the fiber and wake are quasiparabolic at large velocities, and obtains the new drag law in terms of the drag on the tip region. Under variations of the model suggested by the experiment—the addition of flow tunnel walls, and a back pressure in the wake—the drag law persists, with a simple modification.},

We perform a careful numerical comparison against experiments on single fibers performed by S.G. Mason and co-workers, who categorized the fiber dynamics into several distinct orbit classes. We show that the orbit class may be determined using a single dimensionless parameter for low Reynolds flows. Lastly, we simulate dilute suspensions containing up to hundreds of fibers using a distributed-memory computer cluster. These simulations serve as a stepping stone for studying more complex suspension dynamics involving aggregation of fibers (or flocculation) and particle sedimentation due to added mass.},

            In this work, we investigate the dynamics of long non-axisymmetric fibres in turbulent channel flow. The experimental facility is the TU Wien Turbulent Water Channel, consisting of a closed water channel (aspect ratio of 10), and the experiments are performed at a shear Reynolds number of 360. Fibres are neutrally buoyant rods that are curved and characterised by a length-to-diameter ratio of 120. Illumination is provided by a laser sheet and the motion of fibres is recorded by four high-speed cameras in a fully developed flow section. We apply multiplicative algebraic reconstruction techniques to the recorded images from four high-speed cameras to identify the three-dimensional location, shape and orientation of the fibres. The fibres are also tracked in time to obtain their three-dimensional vectors of velocity and rotation rate. We investigate the behaviour of the fibres, from the near-wall region to the channel centre, and we produce original statistics on the effect of curvature of the fibres on their orientation and rotation rate. Specifically, we measured the orientation and rotation rate of the fibres, and we can confirm that in the centre, the most homogeneous part of the channel, statistics, although influenced by the curvature, bear similarities to those obtained in previous investigations in homogeneous isotropic turbulence. In addition, we have been able to compare the tumbling rate of our long non-axisymmetric fibres with previous solutions for curved ellipsoids in simple shear flow.},

In general, the two schemes yield similar results, including for the dominant scaling features of the shape that we identify. In particular, we focus on the evolution of an initially straight ﬁbre oriented in the ﬂow direction and show that the time scales of ﬁbre bending, curling and rotation, which depend on its length and stiffness, determine the overall motion and evolution of the shapes. We document several characteristic time scales and curvatures representative of the shape that vary as power laws of the bending stiffness and ﬁbre length. The numerical results are further supported by an interpretation using an elastica model.},

In the cellular Taylor-Green ﬂow, the buckling probability is a function of a dimensionless number, called Sperm number, which is a balance between the compression rate of the ﬂow and the elastic response of the ﬁlament. The shapes of the ﬁlament and its ability to buckle have been successfully validated through comparisons with experiments from the work by Quennouz et al. (2015). The deformation statistics of long ﬂexible ﬁbers in sustained homogeneous isotropic turbulence were analyzed for various ﬂow and ﬁber material conditions. Two regimes have been identiﬁed depending on the ratio of ﬁber length to persistence length which is a measure of turbulent forcing to ﬂexibility. The numerical results are in good agreement with existing experimental data (C. Brouzet et al., Phys. Rev.

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of ﬂexible ﬁbers in turbulent channel ﬂow. Fibers are longer than the Kolmogorov length scale of the carrier ﬂow, and their velocity relative to the surrounding ﬂuid is non-negligible. Our aim is to examine the effect of local shear and turbulence anisotropy on the translational and rotational behavior of the ﬁbers, considering different elongation (parameterized by the aspect ratio, λ) and inertia (parameterized by the Stokes number, St). To these aims, we use a Eulerian–Lagrangian approach based on direct numerical simulation of turbulence in the dilute regime. Fibers are modeled as chains of sub-Kolmogorov rods (referred to as elements hereinafter) connected through ball-and-socket joints that enable bending and twisting under the action of the local ﬂuid velocity gradients. Velocity, orientation, and concentration statistics, extracted from simulations at shear Reynolds number Reτ = 150 (based on the channel half height), are presented to give insights into the complex ﬁber–turbulence interactions that arise when non-sphericity and deformability add to inertial bias. These statistical observables are examined at varying aspect ratios (namely λr = lr /a = 2 and 5, with lr the semi-length of each rod-like element r composing the ﬁber and a its cross-sectional radius) and varying ﬁber inertia (considering values of the element Stokes number, Str = 1, 5, 30). To highlight the effect of ﬂexibility, statistics are compared with those obtained for ﬁbers of equal mass that translate and rotate as rigid bodies relative to the surrounding ﬂuid. Flexible ﬁbers exhibit a stronger tendency to accumulate in the very-near-wall region, where they appear to be trapped by the same inertia-driven mechanisms that govern the preferential concentration of spherical particles and rigid ﬁbers in bounded ﬂows. In such region, the bending of ﬂexible ﬁbers increases as inertia decreases, and ﬁber deformation appears to be controlled by mean shear and turbulent Reynolds stresses. Preferential segregation into low-speed streaks and preferential orientation in the mean ﬂow direction is also observed.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of a ﬂexible ﬁlament sedimenting in a viscous ﬂuid are explored analytically and numerically. Compared with the well-studied case of sedimenting rigid rods, the introduction of ﬁlament compliance is shown to cause a signiﬁcant alteration in the long-time sedimentation orientation and ﬁlament geometry. A model is developed by balancing viscous, elastic and gravitational forces in a slender-body theory for zero-Reynolds-number ﬂows, and the ﬁlament dynamics are characterized by a dimensionless elasto-gravitation number. Filaments of both non-uniform and uniform cross-sectional thickness are considered. In the weakly ﬂexible regime, a multiple-scale asymptotic expansion is used to obtain expressions for ﬁlament translations, rotations and shapes. These are shown to match excellently with full numerical simulations. Furthermore, we show that trajectories of sedimenting ﬂexible ﬁlaments, unlike their rigid counterparts, are restricted to a cloud whose envelope is determined by the elasto-gravitation number. In the highly ﬂexible regime we show that a ﬁlament sedimenting along its long axis is susceptible to a buckling instability. A linear stability analysis provides a dispersion relation, illustrating clearly the competing effects of the compressive stress and the restoring elastic force in the buckling process. The instability travels as a wave along the ﬁlament opposite the direction of gravity as it grows and the predicted growth rates are shown to compare favourably with numerical simulations. The linear eigenmodes of the governing equation are also studied, which agree well with the ﬁnite-amplitude buckled shapes arising in simulations.},

Aside from round-off error, the modified equation represents the actual partial differential equation solved when a numerical solution is computed using a finite-difference equation. The modified equation is derived by first expanding each term of a difference scheme in a Taylor series and then eliminating time derivatives higher than first order by the algebraic manipulations described herein. The connection between “heuristic” stability theory based on the modified equation approach and the von Neumann (Fourier) method is established. In addition to the determination of necessary and sufficient conditions for computational stability, a truncated version of the modified equation can be used to gain insight into the nature of both dissipative and dispersive errors.},

	abstract = {Warming and Hyett developed a modified equation technique in which the behavior of a difference scheme is evaluated by using the coefficients of a certain modified equation. Specifically, they discovered a connection between these coefficients and the multiplication factor obtained from the von Neumann analysis. Since the dissipation and dispersion off error components are determined by the multiplication factor, the former properties can be studied using the coefficients of the modified equation. The work of Warming and Hyett represents a key step in the development of the method of modified equations. Through this work, it became clear that modified equations should be derived from the difference scheme rather than from the original differential equation. However, in order to “prove” the above connection, Warming and Hyett incorrectly interpreted their modified equations as the actual partial differential equations solved by the difference schemes. The main purpose of the current study is to investigate rigorously the above connection without using their interpretation. The result of this investigation shows that the above connection is only partially valid for multilevel schemes. In the von Neumann analysis, the multiplication factor associated with a wave number generally has (L − 1) roots for an L-level scheme. It is shown that the coefficients of the modified equation provide information for only the principal root.},

An efficient implementation of the tree is described that requires 2N words of memory. A filtering algorithm for removing high-frequency noise during mesh refinement is described. A FTT can be used in various numerical applications. In this paper, it is applied to the integration of the Euler equations of fluid dynamics. An adaptive-mesh time stepping algorithm is described in which different time steps are used at different levels of the tree. Time stepping and mesh refinement are interleaved to avoid extensive buffer layers of fine mesh which were otherwise required ahead of moving shocks. Test examples are presented, and the FTT performance is evaluated.

	abstract = {A partitioned iterative scheme based on Petrov–Galerkin formulation by Jaiman et al. (2016) has been employed for simulating flow past a freely vibrating circular cylinder placed in proximity to a stationary plane wall. In the first part of this work, wall proximity effects on the vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) of an elastically mounted circular cylinder with two degree-of-freedom (2-DoF) are systematically studied in two-dimension (2D) laminar flow at Reynolds number, Re = 200 based on the diameter of cylinder. We investigate the hydrodynamic forces, vibration characteristics, phase relations, response frequencies, motion trajectories as well as vortex shedding patterns. For that purpose, a careful comparison has been established between the isolated and near-wall cylinders. Our 2D simulations reveal that (i) the vibrating near-wall cylinder exhibits larger streamwise oscillation and smaller streamwise vibration frequency as compared to its isolated counterpart owing to the energy transfer from fluid to cylinder and streamwise frequency lock-in caused by the suppression of shear layer roll-up from the bottom cylinder surface; (ii) the mechanism of this vortex shedding suppression for the near-wall configuration can be described by a cyclic process where counter-clockwise vortices shed from the bottom surface of the cylinder force the wall boundary layer to separate and induce secondary clockwise vortices which merge with clockwise vortices shed from the upper surface of the cylinder, eventually suppressing the counter-clockwise vortices from the bottom cylinder surface; (iii) beating oscillations during VIV are found at the critical reduced velocities entering and leaving the lock-in region; and (iv) VIV response becomes much more sensitive to the wall proximity in the energy-in phase than in the energy-out phase. In the second part, we perform three-dimensional (3D) simulations for VIV of a circular cylinder for both isolated and near-wall cases at subcritical Re = 1000. We compare the hydrodynamic forces and vibration characteristics in 3D with the results corresponding to the 2D study at Re = 200. We show that the wall proximity effects on VIV are also pronounced in 3D with the following observations: (i) the wall proximity increases the mean lift force to a lesser extent as compared to 2D at Re = 200; (ii) the wall proximity also enhances the streamwise oscillation to a lesser extent as compared to 2D at Re = 200; and (iii) the wall proximity increases the wavelength of streamwise vorticity blob.},

We propose a simple yet compact representation that exactly matches the intrinsic DOFs and naturally satisﬁes all such constraints. Speciﬁcally, viewing a rod as a chain of rigid segments, we encode its shape as the Cartesian coordinates of its root vertex, and use axis-angle representation for the material frame on each segment. Under our representation, the Hessian of the implicit time-stepping has special non-zero patterns. Exploiting such specialties, we can solve the associated linear equations in nearly linear complexity. Furthermore, we carefully designed a preconditioner, which is proved to be always symmetric positive-deﬁnite and accelerates the PCG solver in one or two orders of magnitude compared with the widely used block-diagonal one. Compared with other technical choices including Super-Helices, a specially designed compact representation for inextensible Cosserat rods, our method achieves better performance and stability, and can simulate an inextensible Cosserat rod with hundreds of vertices and tens of collisions in real time under relatively large time steps.},

The framework comes with a geometric multigrid solver, shared-memory (OpenMP) parallelism and it supports output in Silo and VTK file formats. Afivo can be used to efficiently simulate AMR problems with up to about 108 unknowns on desktops, workstations or single compute nodes. For larger problems, existing distributed-memory frameworks are better suited. The framework has no built-in functionality for specific physics applications, so users have to implement their own numerical methods. The included multigrid solver can be used to efficiently solve elliptic partial differential equations such as Poisson’s equation. Afivo’s design was kept simple, which in combination with the sharedmemory parallelism facilitates modification and experimentation with AMR algorithms. The framework was already used to perform 3D simulations of streamer discharges, which required tens of millions of cells.},

Then we demonstrate its functionality with 3D simulations of long positive streamers in nitrogen in undervolted gaps. Three examples are presented.

The approach uses a finite-volume discretization, which embeds the domain in a regular Cartesian grid. We treat the solution as a cell-centered quantity, even when those centers are outside the domain. Cells that contain a portion of the domain boundary use conservative differencing of second-order accurate fluxes, on each cell volume. The calculation of the boundary flux ensures that the conditioning of the matrix is relatively unaffected by small cell volumes. This allows us to use multi-grid iterations with a simple point relaxation strategy. We have combined this with an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) procedure. We provide evidence that the algorithm is second-order accurate on various exact solutions, and compare the adaptive and non-adaptive calculations.},

At T-junction conﬁgurations, which occur wherever resolution diﬀers between neighbouring cells, use of the standard centred diﬀerence gradient stencil requires that ghost values be constructed by interpolation. To properly recover second order accuracy in the resulting numerical gradients, prior work addressing block-structured grids and graded trees has shown that quadratic, rather than linear, interpolation is required; the gradients otherwise exhibit only ﬁrst order convergence, which limits potential applications such as ﬂuid ﬂow. However, previous schemes fail or lose accuracy in the presence of the more complex T-junction geometries arising in the case of general non-graded quadtrees, which place no restrictions on the resolution of neighbouring cells. We therefore propose novel quadratic interpolant constructions for this case that enable second order convergence by relying on stencils oriented diagonally and applied recursively as needed. The method handles complex tree topologies and large resolution jumps between neighbouring cells, even along the domain boundary, and both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are supported. Numerical experiments conﬁrm the overall second order accuracy of the method in the L∞ norm.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a robust projection method on a locally refined mesh is proposed for two- and three-dimensional viscous incompressible flows. The proposed method is robust not only when the interface between two meshes is located in a smooth flow region but also when the interface is located in a flow region with large gradients and/or strong unsteadiness. In numerical simulations, a locally refined mesh saves many grid points in regions of relatively small gradients compared with a uniform mesh. For efficiency and ease of implementation, we consider a two-level blocked structure, for which both of the coarse and fine meshes are uniform Cartesian ones individually. Unfortunately, the introduction of the two-level blocked mesh results in an important but difficult issue: coupling of the coarse and fine meshes. In this paper, by properly addressing the issue of the coupling, we propose a stable and accurate projection method on a locally refined staggered mesh for both two- and three-dimensional viscous incompressible flows. The proposed projection method is based on two principles: the linear interpolation technique and the consistent discretization of both sides of the pressure Poisson equation. The proposed algorithm is straightforward owing to the linear interpolation technique, is stable and accurate, is easy to extend from two- to three-dimensional flows, and is valid even when flows with large gradients cross the interface between the two meshes. The resulting pressure Poisson equation is non-symmetric on a locally refined mesh. The numerical results for a series of exact solutions for 2D and 3D viscous incompressible flows verify the stability and accuracy of the proposed projection method. The method is also applied to some challenging problems, including turbulent flows around particles, flows induced by impulsively started/stopped particles, and flows induced by particles near solid walls, to test the stability and accuracy.

However, its traditional reliance on a fixed-resolution grid is not ideal for simulations that simultaneously exhibit both large and small-scale fluid phenomena. Octree-based fluid simulation approaches have provided the needed adaptivity, but the inherent weakness of a pointer-based tree structure has limited their effectiveness. We present a linear octree structure that provides a significant runtime speedup using these octree-based simulation algorithms. As memory prices continue to decline, we leverage additional memory when compared to traditional octree structures to provide this improvement. In addition to reducing the level of indirection in the data, because our linear octree is stored contiguously in memory as a simple C array rather than a recursive set of pointers, we provide a more cache-friendly data layout than a traditional octree. In our testing, our approach yielded run-times that were 1.5 to nearly 5 times faster than the same simulations running on a traditional octree implementation.},

The main idea is to incorporate Peskin’s regularized delta function approach [Acta Numerica 11 (2002) 1] into a direct formulation of the ﬂuid-solid interaction force in order to allow for a smooth transfer between Eulerian and Lagrangian representations while at the same time avoiding strong restrictions of the time step. This technique was implemented in a ﬁnite-diﬀerence and fractional-step context. A variety of two- and three-dimensional simulations are presented, ranging from the ﬂow around a single cylinder to the sedimentation of 1000 spherical particles. The accuracy and eﬃciency of the current method are clearly demonstrated.},

A fully implicit time advancement is employed to avoid the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy restriction, where the Crank–Nicolson discretization is used for both the diffusion and convection terms. Based on a block LU decomposition, velocity–pressure decoupling is achieved in conjunction with the approximate factorization. The main emphasis is placed on the additional decoupling of the intermediate velocity components with only nth time step velocity. The temporal second-order accuracy is preserved with the approximate factorization without any modification of boundary conditions. Since the decoupled momentum equations are solved without iteration, the computational time is reduced significantly. The present decoupling method is validated by solving several test cases, in particular, the turbulent minimal channel flow unit. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The approach preserves the robustness of the original finite-volume Saint-Venant solver, in particular for the treatment of wetting/drying and equilibrium states. The linear system of coupled vector equations governing the dispersive SGN momentum sources is solved simply and efficiently using a generic multigrid solver. This approach generalises automatically to adaptive quadtree meshes.

	abstract = {Today's largest supercomputers have 100,000s of processor cores and offer the potential to solve partial differential equations discretized by billions of unknowns. However, the complexity of scaling to such large machines and problem sizes has so far prevented the emergence of generic software libraries that support such computations, although these would lower the threshold of entry and enable many more applications to benefit from large-scale computing.
            We are concerned with providing this functionality for mesh-adaptive finite element computations. We assume the existence of an “oracle” that implements the generation and modification of an adaptive mesh distributed across many processors, and that responds to queries about its structure. Based on querying the oracle, we develop scalable algorithms and data structures for generic finite element methods. Specifically, we consider the parallel distribution of mesh data, global enumeration of degrees of freedom, constraints, and postprocessing. Our algorithms remove the bottlenecks that typically limit large-scale adaptive finite element analyses.
            We demonstrate scalability of complete finite element workflows on up to 16,384 processors. An implementation of the proposed algorithms, based on the open source software p4est as mesh oracle, is provided under an open source license through the widely used deal.II finite element software library.},

We consider non-graded Cartesian grids, i.e. grids for which the diﬀerence in size between two adjacent cells is not constrained. We sample the solutions at the cell vertices (nodes) and use a quadtree data structure as an eﬃcient means to represent the grids. The boundary of the irregular domain is represented by the zero value points of a level set function. For cells cut by the interface, both the interface’s location and the value of the solution at the interface are found by quadratic interpolation. In the case of the heat equation, we use a second order implicit discretization in time to avoid the stringent time step restrictions associated with explicit schemes. This discretization can be applied in a dimension by dimension framework, producing a scheme that is straightforward to implement. Numerical results in two spatial dimensions demonstrate second order accuracy for both the solution and its gradient in the L1 and L∞ norms.},

By distributing the union of octants from all octrees in parallel, we combine the high scalability proven previously for adaptive single-octree algorithms with the geometric ﬂexibility that can be achieved by arbitrarily connected hexahedral macromeshes, in which each macroelement is the root of an adapted octree. A key concept of our approach is an encoding scheme of the interoctree connectivity that permits arbitrary relative orientations between octrees. Based on this encoding we develop interoctree transformations of octants. These form the basis for high-level parallel octree algorithms, which are designed to interact with an application code such as a numerical solver for partial diﬀerential equations. We have implemented and tested these algorithms in the p4est software library. We demonstrate the parallel scalability of p4est on its own and in combination with two geophysics codes. Using p4est we generate and adapt multioctree meshes with up to 5.13 × 1011 octants on as many as 220,320 CPU cores and execute the 2:1 balance algorithm in less than 10 seconds per million octants per process.},

	abstract = {This paper reports the computer simulation of a flapping flexible filament in a flowing soap film using the immersed boundary method. Our mathematical formulation includes filament mass and elasticity, gravity, air resistance, and the two wires that bound the flowing soap film. The incompressible viscous Navier–Stokes equations, which are used to describe the motion of the soap film and filament in our formulation, are discretized on a fixed uniform Eulerian lattice while the filament equations are discretized on a moving Lagrangian array of points which do not necessarily coincide with the fixed Eulerian mesh points of the fluid computation. The interaction between the filament and the soap film is handled by a smoothed approximation to the Dirac delta function. This delta function approximation is used not only to interpolate the fluid velocity and to apply force to the fluid (as is commonly done in immersed boundary computations), but also to handle the mass of the filament, which is represented in our calculation as delta function layer of fluid mass density supported along the immersed filament. Because of this nonuniform density, we need to use a multigrid method for solving the discretized fluid equations. This replaces the FFT-based method that is commonly used in the uniform-density case. Our main results are as follows. (i) The sustained flapping of the filament only occurs when filament mass is included in the formulation of the model; within a certain range of mass, the more the mass of the filament, the bigger the amplitude of the flapping. (ii) When the length of filament is short enough (below some critical length), the filament always approaches its straight (rest) state, in which the filament points downstream; but when the length is larger, the system is bistable, which means that it can settle into either state (rest state or sustained flapping) depending on the initial conditions. This numerical result we observed in computer simulation is the same as that of the laboratory experiment even though the Reynolds number of the computations is lower than that of the laboratory experiment by two orders of magnitude.},

	abstract = {A novel technique related to Peskin's immersed boundary approach is used to introduce solid surfaces into a simulated flow field. The Navier-Stokes equations permit the presence of an externally imposed body force that may vary in space and time. Forces are chosen to lie along a desired surface and to have a magnitude and direction opposing the local flow such that the flow is brought to rest on an element of the surface. For unsteady viscous flow the direct calculation of the needed force is facilitated by a feedback scheme in which the velocity is used to iteratively determine the desired value. In particular, we determine the surface body force from the relation f(x5, t ) = α ∫t0 U(x5, t′ ) dt′ + βU(x5, t) for surface points x5, velocity U, time t, and negative constants α and β. Examples are presented which include 2D flow around cylinders, 3D turbulent channel flow where one boundary is simulated with a force field, and turbulent channel flow over a riblet-covered surface. While the new method may be applied to complex geometries on a non-Cartesian mesh, we have chosen to use a simple Cartesian grid. All simulations are done with a spectral code in a single computational domain without any mapping of the mesh.},
